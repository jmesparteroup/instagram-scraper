# Instagram Scraper API - Updates & Todo List

## Project Overview
Flask API endpoint for scraping Instagram posts using Crawl4AI and OpenAI for structured data extraction.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Initial Setup
- [x] Created project structure
- [x] Set up requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- [x] Created configuration system with environment variables
- [x] Set up Pydantic models for data validation and structure

### Core Features
- [x] Implemented InstagramScraper class with Crawl4AI integration
- [x] Added OpenAI structured output parsing using gpt-4o-mini
- [x] Created Flask API with POST endpoint `/scrape`
- [x] Added input validation for Instagram URLs
- [x] Implemented proper error handling and responses
- [x] Added health check endpoint `/health`

### Data Extraction
- [x] Defined comprehensive Instagram post data structure
- [x] Implemented extraction for all required fields:
  - caption, type, url, videoUrl, imageUrl, displayUrl
  - shortCode, timestamp, likesCount, commentsCount
  - videoViewCount, videoPlayCount, ownerUsername, ownerFullName
  - locationName, hashtags, mentions, alt text

### High Priority Items (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
- [x] **Add environment file (.env) setup instructions**
  - Created `env.example` with all configuration variables
  - Created comprehensive `setup_environment.md` with step-by-step instructions
  - Added troubleshooting guide and security notes

- [x] **Test Instagram scraping with different post types (image, video, carousel)**
  - Created comprehensive test suite with pytest
  - Added tests for image posts, video posts, and carousel posts
  - Created integration tests for real-world scenarios
  - Added edge case testing (emojis, long captions, zero engagement)

- [x] **Implement rate limiting for API endpoint**
  - Added Flask-Limiter with Redis backend
  - Configurable rate limits via environment variables
  - Default: 10 requests per minute general, 5 per minute for scraping
  - Proper error handling for rate limit exceeded

- [x] **Add logging configuration**
  - Comprehensive logging system with configurable levels
  - Structured logging with timestamps and proper formatting
  - Separate log file (`instagram_scraper.log`)
  - Reduced noise from external libraries
  - Request/response logging with IP tracking

- [x] **Create comprehensive error handling for Instagram access restrictions**
  - Enhanced error categorization and handling
  - Specific handling for private posts, deleted posts, rate limiting
  - OpenAI API error handling (quota, billing, rate limits)
  - Network error handling with retry logic
  - Proper HTTP status codes for different error types

### Testing Infrastructure (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
- [x] **Structured testing directory with pytest**
  - Created `tests/` directory with proper structure
  - `conftest.py` with shared fixtures and configuration
  - `test_api.py` - Comprehensive API endpoint tests
  - `test_scraper.py` - Instagram scraper functionality tests
  - `test_models.py` - Pydantic model validation tests
  - `test_integration.py` - Integration tests for different post types
  - `pytest.ini` - Test configuration and markers
  - `run_tests.py` - Easy test runner script

### Enhanced Features (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
- [x] **Retry logic for Instagram scraping**
  - Configurable retry attempts and delays
  - Exponential backoff for failed requests
  - Better handling of temporary failures

- [x] **Enhanced Crawl4AI configuration**
  - Improved browser headers for better Instagram compatibility
  - Optimized timeouts and page loading settings
  - Better content validation and error detection

- [x] **Improved OpenAI integration**
  - Enhanced prompts for better data extraction
  - Token optimization and content truncation
  - Better error handling and validation
  - Automatic shortCode extraction from URLs

## üîÑ In Progress Tasks

None - All high priority items completed!

## üìã Todo List

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add request/response examples to documentation
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for scraped data
- [ ] Add metrics collection (response times, success rates)
- [ ] Add input sanitization and security measures

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add support for Instagram Stories (if feasible)
- [ ] Implement batch scraping for multiple URLs
- [ ] Add webhook support for automated scraping
- [ ] Create web interface for testing the API
- [ ] Add Docker containerization
- [ ] Implement authentication/API key system

### Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Document deployment instructions
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## üêõ Known Issues
- [ ] Instagram may block requests without proper session handling
- [ ] OpenAI API costs need to be monitored
- [ ] Crawl4AI may need browser configuration for Instagram

## üîß Technical Debt
- [ ] Add proper async handling in Flask (consider using Quart)
- [ ] Implement proper configuration management
- [ ] Add database support for storing scraped data
- [ ] Optimize OpenAI prompt for better extraction accuracy

## üìä Performance Considerations
- [ ] Monitor Crawl4AI performance with Instagram
- [ ] Optimize OpenAI token usage
- [ ] Implement request queuing for high traffic
- [ ] Add timeout configurations

## üöÄ Deployment
- [ ] Set up production environment configurations
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (nginx/apache)
