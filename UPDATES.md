# Instagram Scraper API - Updates & Todo List

## Project Overview
Flask API endpoint for scraping Instagram posts using Crawl4AI and OpenAI for structured data extraction.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Initial Setup
- [x] Created project structure
- [x] Set up requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- [x] Created configuration system with environment variables
- [x] Set up Pydantic models for data validation and structure

### Core Features
- [x] Implemented InstagramScraper class with Crawl4AI integration
- [x] Added OpenAI structured output parsing using gpt-4o-mini
- [x] Created Flask API with POST endpoint `/scrape`
- [x] Added input validation for Instagram URLs
- [x] Implemented proper error handling and responses
- [x] Added health check endpoint `/health`

### Data Extraction
- [x] Defined comprehensive Instagram post data structure
- [x] Implemented extraction for all required fields:
  - caption, type, url, videoUrl, imageUrl, displayUrl
  - shortCode, timestamp, likesCount, commentsCount
  - videoViewCount, videoPlayCount, ownerUsername, ownerFullName
  - locationName, hashtags, mentions, alt text

## üîÑ In Progress Tasks

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test the API with real Instagram URLs
- [ ] Validate OpenAI structured output parsing
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

## üìã Todo List

### High Priority
- [ ] Add environment file (.env) setup instructions
- [ ] Test Instagram scraping with different post types (image, video, carousel)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoint
- [ ] Add logging configuration
- [ ] Create comprehensive error handling for Instagram access restrictions

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add request/response examples to documentation
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for scraped data
- [ ] Add metrics collection (response times, success rates)
- [ ] Create unit tests for scraper functionality
- [ ] Add input sanitization and security measures

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add support for Instagram Stories (if feasible)
- [ ] Implement batch scraping for multiple URLs
- [ ] Add webhook support for automated scraping
- [ ] Create web interface for testing the API
- [ ] Add Docker containerization
- [ ] Implement authentication/API key system

### Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Document deployment instructions
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## üêõ Known Issues
- [ ] Instagram may block requests without proper session handling
- [ ] OpenAI API costs need to be monitored
- [ ] Crawl4AI may need browser configuration for Instagram

## üîß Technical Debt
- [ ] Add proper async handling in Flask (consider using Quart)
- [ ] Implement proper configuration management
- [ ] Add database support for storing scraped data
- [ ] Optimize OpenAI prompt for better extraction accuracy

## üìä Performance Considerations
- [ ] Monitor Crawl4AI performance with Instagram
- [ ] Optimize OpenAI token usage
- [ ] Implement request queuing for high traffic
- [ ] Add timeout configurations

## üöÄ Deployment
- [ ] Set up production environment configurations
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (nginx/apache)
